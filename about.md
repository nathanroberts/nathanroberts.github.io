I'm Nathan Roberts, a designer at [Google](https://google.com). Before, I led small design teams at [Experian](http://experian.com/) and [Oakley](http://oakley.com/).

I'm most invested when I'm building something meaningful for people that creates positive impact. I enjoy working with others, not in a silo. I get excited about technology and using it to improve our everyday lives.

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
I have an *incredible* family -- I'm a proud dad and husband! Together we have four kids: Abram ðŸ‘¦, Hazel ðŸ‘§, Maren ðŸ‘§ and Rex ðŸ‘¦.
